Types of testing:--->

	1. Unit Testing
	2. Integration Testing
	3. System Testing
	4. User acceptance testing


UnitTesting:-->
		During unit testing programmer test each program using below techniques

		1. Basicpath testing
		2. Control structure testing
		3. program technique testing
		4. Mutation Testing


	Basicpath Testing:-->
		During this testing programmer execute each program 
		more than two times to cover all executable areas.

		age=21
		if age > 18
		    print "Valid"
		else
		    print "Invalid"

		=> First time to execute true condition to verify
		=> Second time execute false condition to verify


		age=2
		if age > 1
		   print "valid age"
			if(age > 60)
		   	print "age exceded terms and conditions applied"
		else
		   print "Invalid age"	


		1. Testwith valid age >1  and Lessthan 60
		2. Test with invalid age <1
		3. Test with range > 1  and > 60


Coverage testing:-->

	During this test programmer verify each program 
	input and outputs.Programmer condcut walkthrough 
	on each and every line of program.

	This process also called debugging progam.

	What is debugging:-->
		Programmer check every line of program is 
		executing without runtime erros.


 Program technique testing:-->

	During this test programmer check execution speed of program.
	If execution speed is not resonable program make changes 
	to imporve execution speed.


	Starttime
	     ProgramA
	Total=EndTime-StartTime
				
	What exactly develpers do improve speed of program:--->

		1. Use low memory variable to improve speed
		2. Remove unwanted code 
		3. Optimize program lines into shotter 

	Example:-->
			a=10, b=5

 Mutation Testing:-->
				
	During this test programmer create more mutant 
	programs and execute each mutant program with some changes
	

	1. After execution if mutant build performing
	   better than real build program the developer replace 
	   real program with mutant program. 

	2. Incase mutant build failed programmer decleare that one 
	   as dead code.




Integration Testing:-->

	After completed unit testing,  programmer integrate all 
	related programs and check program integration between
	all parent and sub programs.

	
		Top-Down Approach
		Bottom-up Approach
		Hybrid approach
		System approach
